# Valetudo to VMF
This little script can be used to convert [Valetudo](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo) Mapdata (containing segments) to Source-Engine VMF Maps (for use with the Hammer Editor).

In its current state it is neither very flexible nor easily extendable. I don't know if I will ever do aynthing more than this proof of concept. If you're reading this, feel free to go wild with the idea :).
